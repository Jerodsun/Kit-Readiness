### Feature Requirements

1. **Database Design**
   - **Kits Table**: Stores information about each kit (kit_id, kit_name, description).
   - **Components Table**: Stores information about each component (component_id, component_name, description).
   - **KitComponents Table**: Stores the relationship between kits and components (kit_id, component_id, quantity).
   - **Warehouses Table**: Stores information about each warehouse (warehouse_id, warehouse_name, location).
   - **WarehouseInventory Table**: Stores the inventory of components at each warehouse (warehouse_id, component_id, quantity).
   - **CompletedKits Table**: Stores information about completed kits at each warehouse (warehouse_id, kit_id, quantity).
2. **API Endpoints**
   - **Kits API**: CRUD operations for kits.
   - **Components API**: CRUD operations for components.
   - **Warehouses API**: CRUD operations for warehouses.
   - **WarehouseInventory API**: CRUD operations for warehouse inventory.
   - **CompletedKits API**: CRUD operations for completed kits.
   - **Readiness Dashboard API**: Endpoint to get data for the readiness dashboard.
   - **Map Data API**: Endpoint to get data for the map visualization.
   - **Kit Calculator API**: Endpoint to calculate the number of kits that can be made at each warehouse.
   - **Rebalancing Algorithm API**: Endpoint to run the rebalancing algorithm.
   - **Transfer Request API**: Endpoint to create and manage transfer requests between warehouses.
3. **Readiness Dashboard**
   - **Dashboard UI**: Display the number of kits that can be created against a benchmark.
   - **Data Visualization**: Use Plotly to create charts and graphs for visualizing readiness data.
4. **Map Visualization**
   - **Map UI**: Display a map showing warehouse locations using Plotly.
   - **Drilldown Functionality**: Allow users to click on a warehouse to see the material components in that warehouse.
5. **Kit Calculator**
   - **Calculator UI**: Provide an interface to calculate the number of kits that can be made at each warehouse.
   - **Calculation Logic**: Implement logic to calculate the number of kits based on available components.
6. **Rebalancing Algorithm**
   - **Algorithm Logic**: Develop an algorithm to maximize the number of kits by rebalancing components between warehouses.
   - **Input Parameters**: Allow users to set parameters such as minimizing transfer requests and setting maximum transfer limits.
7. **Transfer Request Feature**
   - **Request UI**: Provide an interface to create and manage transfer requests between warehouses.
   - **Justification Field**: Include a field for users to provide justification for transfer requests.
8. **User Authentication and Authorization**
   - **Authorization**: Implement role-based access control to restrict access to certain features based on user roles.
9. **Documentation**
   - **User Documentation**: Create user documentation to help users understand how to use the application.
   - **Technical Documentation**: Create technical documentation for developers.
10. **Monitoring and Logging**
    - **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring to track application performance and errors.
    - **Logging**: Implement logging to capture detailed information about application events.

### Design Decisions

- **Backend**: Python with Flask/Dash
- **Database**: SQLite for test/dev/prod
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy for database interactions
- **Frontend**: Dash and Plotly
